                            Travel insurance is available and recommended to protect your travel investment. Many trips, such as tours and cruises, involve non-refundable funds paid months in advance.

                            Travel insurance protects you from losing this investment. Perhaps even more important is the 'during travel' coverage and assistance that comes with the top-flight insurance companies we carry.

                            We are paid by the resorts and other vendors. Many resorts and vendors (such as Expedia, Apple Vacations, Southwest Vacations, etc) have a price parity, meaning the cost is same whether you book through us, direct with the resort, or with an online booking agent or engine.
                        </h3>

                            The difference between using a travel agent is that we help you plan a stress-free vacation without the hassles a third-party agent, or even going at it alone might bring.
                            While some agents might charge a small research fee, often times this is refundable
